When you have a huge collection of documents, you can no longer read all of them
yourself. You want to know **what are all these documents about?** and find out
in a glance.

Once you have your documents up in
[DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/home), you can make them useful in
all sorts of ways. All text is extracted and downloadable, so it's the perfect
set-up for a visualization! 
 
We're going to need some serious tools here. We need [requests](http://docs
.python-requests.org/en/latest/), a full scientific python stack,
[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) and
[t-sne](https://github.com/danielfrg/tsne).
